I didn't know about the diff and FC command, that was interesting but tediuos.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would make easier to track changes and go back to previuos working versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

By relying only on manual commits you can forget to save the file, but it retains the flexibility on when to save the changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google docs work with single documents/files not related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log then enter, remember to type q to quit, then giff diff commit id 1 commit id 2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It makes easier to track where in the changes we have made mistakes
